# ML-MD-SPE
This is the repository for my senior design project/thesis, titled "A Machine Leraning Approach to Study Li<sup>+</sup> Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes."

The code that is currently here is all placeholder. By May 4, 2022 (last day of the semester), I plan to have the following:

- Cleaned Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis, full ML, and two brief ones for feature importances and 3D plotting
- Folder of data
- Folder of all the figures that made it into my thesis
- Folder of all the figures produced for exploratory data analysis and ML that *didn't* go in the thesis
- README files in folders to explain what you're looking at ðŸ˜‰
